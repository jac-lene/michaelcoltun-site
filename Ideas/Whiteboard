Overall
    - Add Back To Top button
    - figure out scrolls
    - need about photo
    - need other content

Responsivity
    - when screen is smaller, get rid of nav links and just leave name

Video play
    - Figure out how to make muted or unmuted, maybe add a button that looks better 
Video Randomizing
    - make an array of objects with the src and the video credits so they can be accessed

FCA
    - Why is NYT video like that >:(
